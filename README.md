# Snyk Technical Assessment


# 1.Explain the difference between a stack and a queue. Provide real life examples of
# real-life scenarios where each of them are used appropriately.

A stack is a data structure that resembles a real-life stack, such as a stack of plates, when we want to get a plate, we always get the plate from the top, that's why a stack is obedient to the LIFO (Last In First Out) method, because the plate at the top is the last one that was place.
In Software, a solid example is a text editor, we keep entering characters and when we press the backspace key, the last character is deleted.

A queue data structure, resembles a real-life queue, for example a queue in a pharmacy, it respects the FIFO(First In First Out) invariant, the first person from the line(queue) is served, after he leaves, the next person from the line is served.
In Software, there could be an application for a Call Center where calls are recieved in a queue, forwrading them by the arrival( time called).

  + The key difference between them is the two principles each respect, when we pop(remove) an element from a stack, the last element added to the stack get's removed, while when we dequeue(remove) from a queue, the first element that is currently in the queue is removed.
